  <h2>About MoBuS</h2>
  
  <p>
    MoBuS (MOE-buhs) n. - A tool used to find bus route information using a mobile Internet device.
  </p>
  <p><b>How it works</b><br>
		This web application uses your input to build a query for specific transit route and scheduling information.<br>
		You can get the same result by visiting http://transit.metrokc.gov. Of course this interface is a little cleaner and is fully supported by small browsers (even HTML-capable cell phones).
  </p>
  <p>
    Mobile Bus Schedule was designed and constructed by Aaron Bronow (<a href="mailto:aaron@bronow.net">aaron@bronow.net</a>). The parsing engine is written in VBScript, the interface is HTML, and the server is running ASP.
